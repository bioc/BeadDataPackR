CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   Added function extractLocsFile()

    o 	Added function readCompressedData()

    o 	decompressBeadData() will now take a vector of input files, rather than requiring a loop.

    o 	Reduced decompression time by about 50% by using .Call() rather than apply()

BUG FIXES

    o   Fixed error when extracting red channel information using readCompressedData(). 
    Thanks to Prof. Tim Triche for identifying and patching this.

    o   Fixed rounding errors when dealing with very small and/or negative coordinates.

    o 	Check indices are now employed correctly.

    o 	If any beads can't be positioned using the reduced index compression halts and the user
	is informed.

    o 	Fixed a major bug that resulted in the .locs file being randomly ordered on reconstruction 
	if the full index was used.

    o 	Now stops and informs the user if there are negative coordinates in the .locs file.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99

NEW FEATURES

    o 	Improved speed when using lossy compression by switcing some code from apply() to .Call()

    o 	Progress bar is now optional

    o 	Package created

BUG FIXES

    o 	Fixed bug which put red channel out by 1 pixel when using offset coordinates

    o 	Now works correctly in the case where an array consists of a single segment, e.g. Human 1M

    o 	Fixed bug in creating full index

    o 	Fixed bug in combining .txt and .locs files due to duplicate entries

    o 	Fixed bug in writing intensity flags.  Introduced when switching from calloc() to R_alloc().

    o 	Set a default file name for output from compressBeadData if left blank

    o 	Compression progress bar no longer stops at 70%

    o 	Set limits on the number of bytes for storing the fractional part
    
    o 	Replaced calloc() with R_alloc() in C code
    
    o 	Registered C functions
